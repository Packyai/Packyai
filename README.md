<!---This is my first day doing something at GitHub-->
<h1>Vaibhav Gupta (Vaib)</h1>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<p>I am a businessman, researcher, lecturer, and an author, who is now turning into a coder and a founder with PackyAI.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Where do you live?</h2>
<p>Adelaide, Australia</p>
<hr />
<h2>How do we know you are who you say you are?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/consultantvaibhav/">LinkedIn</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://people.unisa.edu.au/vaibhav.gupta">University of South Australia Profile</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>So, what is Packy?</h2>
<p>Will tell in good time.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why are you learning to code</h2>
<p>Four reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>Because I cannot find a technical cofounder for Packy.</li>
    <li>Because Packy is only the beginning, not the end.</li>
    <li>Because I love to be able to code my ideas myself</li>
    <li>Because after PhD, I have found a new learning passion in coding</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<hr />
<h2>How are you learning to code?</h2>
<p>By coding everyday, and by learning from Dr. Angela Yu's course @ <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> </p>
<hr/>
<h2>When did you start the course?</h2>
<p>On 26/06/2024</p>
<hr />
<h2>What have you learnt so far?</h2>
<p>HTML: In HTML, I have learned:
  <ol>
    <li>Headings</li>
    <li>Paragraphs</li>
    <li>void tags</li>
    <li>lists: ordered (like this one) and unordered (like the last one)</li>
    <li>Anchor</li>
    <li>Embedding images</li>
    <li>Nested lists (will show later)</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Show an image of you coding.</h2>
<p>I will have to first take a picture and upload it to the Github repository. I will do that once I have finished writing this page.</p>
<h2>What will you learn tonight in Angela's class?</h2>
<p>Tonight's (26/06/2024) topic is called Multi-page websites.</p>
<hr />
<h2>When will you update this page next</h2>
<p>I will update this page tomorrow</p>
<hr />
<h2>What if you don't></h2>
<p>I will eat a Doughnut.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How the hell is that a punishment?</h2>
<p>Because I took a vow to quit processed sugar on August 22, 2022 and haven't eaten it since then. Eating a Doughnut will be breaking the vow.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What's best about Angela's course?</h2>
<p>Many things , such as:
<ul>
  <li>Her content delivery style that includes:
  <ul>
    <li>speed</li>
    <li>speech</li>
    <li>style</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Her extra tips and suggestions such as:
  <ul>
    <li>write a clean code so that everyone can understand</li>
    <li>maintain the heirarchy of codes</li>
    <li>practice everyday and code not with her video but after watching her video, once I have completely understood why a code does what it does.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr />
<h2>What else do you love to do?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hiking: I hiked Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest point in East Africa at 5895 mts on January 25, 2024. (will resize the photo to smaller version once I have learnt how to do that from Angela)</li>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="https://github.com/Packyai/Packyai/blob/main/20240125_083953.jpg" alt="Photos of me on Kili's Top" /></li>
    </ul>
  <li>Motorbiking: I cannot live without a motorbike. I feel free when cool wind touches my face. (Same as above for the photo resizing)</li>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="https://github.com/Packyai/Packyai/blob/main/20240313_004621.jpg" alt="My XSR 900 motorbike" /></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<hr />
See you tomorrow (on 27/06/2024)!
